# unicorn

In previous, I implmented this [repo](https://github.com/Incarnation-p-lee/excalibur) based on [JamesM's kernel development tutorials](http://jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/).
It was in the C language which may need to write many code than expectation.

For now, I am not sure if I can fast it by migrating most code to golang, except for some
necessary ASM code.

Let's have a try and enjon design and coding!
